I want to develop a full-stack web application titled 'HumanLike-AwareBot: A Social Engineering Awareness Training Platform'. This platform will be used to increase employee awareness about social engineering threats and organizational policies through a gamified chatbot experience.

The app should meet the following criteria and functionality:

Core Features:
User Authentication:

The app should have a Login and Sign-up page where users can create an account and log in securely. If they don’t have an account, they should be able to sign up.

Use JWT for authentication and password hashing for security.

Project Acknowledgement Page:

After logging in, the user should be redirected to an Acknowledgement Page that provides a brief description of the project and the purpose of the social engineering awareness program.

User Dashboard:

The Dashboard should be clean and user-friendly. The dashboard will have the following sections:

Chatbot: Integrated as a real-time chatbot using an LLM (Language Learning Model) API to provide answers to user questions related to social engineering threats.

Organization Awareness and Policy: Information about the organization’s policies and security measures.

Social Engineering Threat Scenarios: A section that presents updated, real-world social engineering scenarios to the user.

Gamified Training: The chatbot will guide users through training modules in a gamified manner (with points, achievements, or levels).

Progress Tracker: A section that tracks the user's progress in completing the social engineering awareness training.

Chatbot:

The Chatbot should provide real-time answers using a LLM Model API. The chatbot should be present across all pages, ideally in a fixed position, for instant access.

Technologies:

Frontend: React, with responsive design for desktop and mobile.

Backend: Flask to handle the APIs, user authentication, and data processing.

Database: MongoDB for storing user data and SQLite for session and training data.

Git for version control and collaboration.

Deployment: The web app should be deployable on platforms like Heroku for the backend and Netlify for the frontend.

Project Abstract:
HumanLike-AwareBot is a gamified, chatbot-based platform aimed at increasing employee awareness of social engineering threats and organizational policies. Social engineering remains a significant cybersecurity threat due to the exploitation of human behavior. Traditional awareness methods are often passive and ineffective. Our objective is to develop an interactive web application that simulates real-world scenarios and tracks user responses. Using a Flask backend and React frontend, we have created a system that delivers dynamic scenarios, feedback, and user progress tracking. The chatbot enhances engagement by offering real-time information through a search bar and gamified training modules. This solution provides an enjoyable yet educational experience that helps organizations strengthen their security posture.

Requirements for Output:
Please generate the code structure for this full-stack application, including:

Frontend: React components for user login/signup, project acknowledgement page, chatbot UI, dashboard, gamified training sections, and progress tracking.

Backend: Flask API endpoints for user authentication, real-time chatbot integration with LLM API, and database connections (MongoDB for user data and SQLite for training progress).

Database models for user data, progress tracking, and chatbot history.

Basic styling for the application, using CSS, Bootstrap, or Material-UI.

Comments explaining the code to help with understanding the structure and functionality.

The app should be easy to extend and maintain, with clear separation between frontend and backend.
